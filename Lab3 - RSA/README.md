RSA
Theoretical background
In cryptography, the RSA encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the integer factorization problem. The system provides an additional layer of security by asymmetrically encrypting keys previously used for symmetric message encryption.
The application
The user is asked to input 2 prime numbers p and q, and then the text to be encrypted/decrypted. The program then generates in the background the corresponding encryption and decryption keys. The plaintext is lowercase and the cypher text is in uppercase for convenience.
